# LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory

**Course Overview**

"LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory" is an intermediate-level course offered by DeepLearning.AI. This course teaches how to build agents with long-term, persistent memory using the Letta framework, enabling efficient context management and editing. It explores how Large Language Model (LLM) agents can function as operating systems to autonomously optimize context usage. The course also covers the application of memory management techniques to create adaptive, collaborative AI agents for real-world tasks such as research and human resources.

**What You'll Learn**

- **Agent Memory Construction**: Develop agents with self-editing memory using tool-calling and multi-step reasoning.
- **Letta Framework**: Utilize Letta, an open-source framework, to enhance LLM agents with advanced reasoning capabilities and transparent long-term memory.
- **MemGPT Concepts**: Understand the key ideas behind the MemGPT paper, including the two tiers of memory and the transformation of agent states into prompts.
- **Agent Interaction**: Create and interact with MemGPT agents using Letta, and learn to build and edit core and archival memory.
- **Core Memory Customization**: Design and implement core memory with custom blocks and memory tools.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Implement multi-agent collaboration through message passing and shared memory blocks.
